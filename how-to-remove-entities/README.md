## Why do I need to remove entities from my training data?

We would like to make the training data as easy as possible to adopt to new training models and annotating entities highly dependant on your botâ€™s purpose. Therefore, we will first focus on collecting training data that only includes intents.

## How to remove entities from your training data 

1. Make sure your training data is backed up! 

2. Open the command line, and use [this simple Python script](https://github.com/RasaHQ/NLU-training-data/blob/master/how-to-remove-entities/entity-remove-script) that replaces all the entity annotations with the plain text.

3. Prepare to donate your training data by following these [guidelines.](https://github.com/RasaHQ/NLU-training-data#how-do-i-donate-my-training-data)
